# Pythodar Workshop 1 – Bug Fixes 🐞

Welcome to **Repo 2** of the **Pythodar Workshop 1** series. This repository focuses on practicing Git workflows while debugging simple Python programs. Fix bugs, test your solutions, and collaborate using Git and GitHub.

---

## Purpose

- Strengthen **Git skills**: clone, add, commit, push, pull.
- Develop **Python debugging skills** by identifying and fixing errors in code.
- Learn **collaborative workflows** using GitHub for team-based projects.

## 📌 Tasks

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the `bugs/` folder.
3. Open each `bugX.py` file (e.g., `bug1.py`, `bug2.py`, etc.).
4. Identify and fix the error(s) in each file until the program runs correctly.
5. Test your changes by running the Python script:
   ```bash
   python bugX.py
   ```
6. Stage, commit, and push your fixes:
   ```bash
   git add bugX.py
   git commit -m "Fixed bug in bugX.py"
   git push
   ```
7. Verify your changes are reflected in the GitHub repository.
8. (Optional) Use `git pull` to sync with any updates from collaborators.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this repository, you will:
- Master core Git commands: `git clone`, `git add`, `git status`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`.
- Gain confidence in debugging basic Python errors.
- Understand collaborative workflows using GitHub branches and commits.
- Build problem-solving skills for real-world coding scenarios.

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Read error messages**: Python error messages often point to the exact issue (e.g., syntax errors, undefined variables).
- **Test incrementally**: Run your program after each change to ensure it works as expected.
- **Commit often**: Make small, frequent commits with clear messages (e.g., "Fixed syntax error in bug3.py").
- **Collaborate**: If working in a team, use `git pull` to stay updated with others' changes.
- **Ask for help**: If stuck, check Python documentation or discuss with peers on GitHub Issues.
